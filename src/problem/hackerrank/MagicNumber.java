	 * Did you find any pattern in which the numbers are stored?
In any magic square, the first number i.e. 1 is stored at position (n/2, n-1). Let this position be (i,j). 
 next number is stored at position (i-1, j+1) where we can consider each row & column as circular array i.e. they wrap around.
Three conditions hold:

1. The position of next number is calculated by decrementing row number of previous number by 1,
 and incrementing the column number of previous number by 1. At any time, if the calculated row position becomes -1, 
 it will wrap around to n-1. Similarly,if the calculated column position becomes n, it will wrap around to 0.
2. If the magic square already contains a number at the calculated position, calculated column position will be decremented by 2,
 and calculated row position will be incremented by 1.
If the calculated row position is -1 & calculated column position is n, the new position would be: (0, n-2).
